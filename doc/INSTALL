To compile MORE:


1. first, make sure you have compiled the "Cats" library for your
   system.  Be sure to use the same memory model (this trips up a lot
   of people.)

2. Then, set the CATS macro in the makefile to the *base* path of the
   CATDB.LIB library file (for example, use C:\SRC\CATS not
   C:\SRC\CATS\LIB\CATS.LIB)


3. Type:

   make -fmakefile.bc


That's it.


Edit the NLS\MORE.EN file to add new English messages.  Feel free to
provide translations of MORE.EN into other languages.  The new
translated files should be named MORE.xx (where "xx" is the
two-letter country abbreviation - for example, Germany would use
MORE.DE and France would use MORE.FR)
